            <div class="disclosure-box">
                <p><strong>Official Disclosure Statement:</strong></p>
                <p>"Best Generator Prices is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com."</p>
            </div>

            <p>This means that when you click on product links on our website and make a purchase on Amazon, we may earn a small commission from Amazon at no additional cost to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. How Our Affiliate Program Works</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Commission Structure</h3>
            <p>Here's how our affiliate relationship with Amazon works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You click a product link</strong> on our website</li>
                <li><strong>You're redirected to Amazon</strong> with our affiliate tracking code</li>
                <li><strong>You make a purchase</strong> (of any eligible product, not just the one you clicked)</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon pays us a commission</strong> (typically 1-10% depending on the product category)</li>
                <li><strong>You pay the same price</strong> - affiliate commissions do not increase your costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 What Qualifies for Commissions</h3>
            <p>We may earn commissions on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The specific generator you clicked on our site</li>
                <li>Any other eligible products you add to your cart during that session</li>
                <li>Products purchased within Amazon's attribution window (typically 24 hours)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 What We Don't Earn Commissions On</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gift cards and certain restricted categories</li>
                <li>Products purchased after the attribution window expires</li>
                <li>Returns, cancellations, or refunded items</li>
                <li>Products excluded from the Associates Program</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Impact on You as a Consumer</h2>

            <div class="important-notice">
                <strong>No Additional Cost to You:</strong> Participating in affiliate programs does NOT increase the price you pay for products. Amazon absorbs the commission cost.

            <h3>3.1 Your Shopping Experience</h3>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Same Shipping:</strong> All shipping, Prime benefits, and delivery options apply normally</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Benefits to You</h3>
