            <div class="question">Q: How do you make money from this website?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: We are participants in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program. When you click on our links and make a purchase on Amazon, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you. This helps us maintain and improve our service.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: Are the prices on your site accurate?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: We strive to provide the most current pricing information by regularly updating our data from Amazon's Product Advertising API. However, prices can change frequently on Amazon. The final price you see on Amazon at checkout will be the actual price you pay.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: Do you sell generators directly?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: No, we do not sell generators directly. We are a comparison and information website that directs you to Amazon where you can make your purchase. All transactions, customer service, returns, and warranties are handled by Amazon and the respective manufacturers.
            </div>

        <h2>Product Information</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: How do you calculate "Price per Watt"?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: Price per Watt is calculated by dividing the current Amazon price by the generator's maximum output wattage. This metric helps you compare the value of different generators regardless of their size. Lower price per watt generally indicates better value.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: What's the difference between battery and gas generators?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: Battery generators (portable power stations) are quiet, emission-free, and can be used indoors, but have limited runtime and need recharging. Gas generators provide longer runtime and higher power output but produce emissions, are louder, and must be used outdoors.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: What does "Wh" mean in battery capacity?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: "Wh" stands for Watt-hours, which indicates how much energy a battery can store. For example, a 1000Wh battery can theoretically power a 100W device for 10 hours or a 1000W device for 1 hour.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: Are refurbished or used generators worth buying?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: Used generators can offer significant savings, but consider the risks: limited or no warranty, unknown maintenance history, and potential reliability issues. Always check the seller's return policy and Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee coverage.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Website Features</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: How do I use the filters on your website?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: Use the left sidebar to filter generators by wattage range, battery capacity, fuel type, engine type, brand, and condition. The results update automatically as you change your selections. This helps narrow down options to generators that meet your specific needs.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: Can I sort the results by different criteria?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: Currently, our table is sorted by price per watt (lowest to highest) to help you find the best value. We may add additional sorting options in future updates based on user feedback.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: Why don't some generators show battery capacity?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: Traditional gas, diesel, and propane generators don't have batteries - they generate power directly from fuel combustion. Only electric generators (battery-powered portable power stations) and solar generators have battery capacity measurements.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Purchasing and Support</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: What happens after I click a product link?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                A: You'll be redirected to the specific product page on Amazon where you can read detailed descriptions, customer reviews, and make your purchase. Your transaction is entirely with Amazon, and you'll receive their customer service and support.

            <div class="answer">
                A: Since purchases are made through Amazon, contact Amazon customer service for any order, shipping, or return issues. For product defects or warranty claims, contact the manufacturer directly. We cannot assist with individual purchase issues.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">Q: Do you provide generator buying advice?</div>
            <div class="answer">
